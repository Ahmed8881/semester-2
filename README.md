## Introduction

This repository highlights the work completed during the second semester of the C# programming course, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming principles. It includes practical implementations of key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism through various tasks and projects. Each example is designed to showcase these principles in action and provide a deeper understanding of OOP in C#.

## Implementation

The repository includes implementations of the following OOP concepts:

- **Inheritance:** Demonstrates how classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.
- **Encapsulation:** Shows how to bundle data and methods into a single unit (class) and control access to it.
- **Abstraction:** Provides examples of abstract classes and methods to define a common interface while hiding implementation details.
- **Polymorphism:** Illustrates how different classes can be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, and how method overriding works.

## Repository Structure

- `Assignments/` - Contains solutions to various C# programming assignments that incorporate OOP concepts.
- `Projects/` - Larger projects completed during the semester, demonstrating advanced applications of OOP principles.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the repository.
